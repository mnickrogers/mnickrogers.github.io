# About Me

I love problem solving and computers are tools that let us solve amazing problems â€” everything from what user interfaces best allow people to freely share their thoughts with each other to how best to design an algorithm to search across vast records stored in a database.

## Bayesian-Sequence
[Check it out here!](https://github.com/mnickrogers/Bayesian-Sequence) This is one I'm still in the middle of, but the idea is pretty simple: Bayesian inference gives us a method of calculating probabilities based on our prior knowledge and observed events. This project creates a way to sequence observations into a synchronized prediction.
