        <h1>Aquinas' Remedies for Sadness</h1>
        <p>Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologica (Prima Secundae Partis, Question 38), outlines five remedies for sorrow (tristitia) or pain, which he treats as a passion of the soul arising from an apprehended evil. These can be applied to sadness or what we might today call depression, though Aquinas' framework is theological and philosophical rather than clinical. He discusses each in a separate article, arguing why they alleviate sorrow by either countering its contracting effect on the soul or providing some form of relief or pleasure.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Seeking Pleasure</h2>
        <p>Aquinas argues that any pleasure assuages sorrow because pleasure provides repose to the appetite in something good, counteracting the unrest caused by sorrow. He states: "As is evident from what has been said above, pleasure is a kind of repose of the appetite in a suitable good; while sorrow arises from something unsuited to the appetite. Consequently in movements of the appetite pleasure is to sorrow, what, in bodies, repose is to weariness." In practice, this means indulging in something enjoyable, like a favorite activity or treat.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Weeping or Expressing Grief</h2>
        <p>Tears and groans help by dispersing the soul's focus outward, reducing the intensity of inward sorrow, and because such expressions are fitting to the sorrowful state, making them somewhat pleasant. Aquinas explains: "A hurtful thing hurts yet more if we keep it shut up, because the soul is more intent on it: whereas if it be allowed to escape, the soul's intention is dispersed as it were on outward things, so that the inward sorrow is lessened." He adds that actions befitting one's disposition bring relief.</p>
        
        <h2>3. The Sympathy of Friends</h2>
        <p>Sharing sorrow with friends lightens the burden, as it feels like others are helping carry it, and their love provides pleasure. He notes: "When one is in pain, it is natural that the sympathy of a friend should afford consolation... it seems as though others were bearing the burden with him, striving, as it were, to lessen its weight." This emphasizes the consoling power of empathy and companionship.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Contemplation of Truth</h2>
        <p>For Aquinas, the highest pleasure comes from contemplating truth, which assuages sorrow, especially for those who love wisdom. He writes: "The greatest of all pleasures consists in the contemplation of truth. Now every pleasure assuages pain... hence the contemplation of truth assuages pain or sorrow, and the more so, the more perfectly one is a lover of wisdom." This could involve philosophical reflection, study, or prayerful meditation on divine truths.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Sleep and Baths</h2>
        <p>These bodily remedies restore the natural disposition of the body, which sorrow disrupts by causing a kind of contraction or exhaustion. Aquinas affirms that sleep and baths provide relaxation and relief, countering sorrow's effects on the vital spirits. (Note: While a popular quote attributes "a glass of wine" to Aquinas alongside sleep and baths, this addition does not appear in Question 38; the original focuses on sleep and baths as means to bodily restoration.)
